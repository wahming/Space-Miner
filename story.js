Story

After 100 years in deep space, you have arrived. Alpha Centauri, the closest star system to us and the object of human hopes and dreams about interstellar exploration. A momentous occasion for humankind. Your place in the history books is guaranteed. But that is of no interest to you, for you are not human. To you, the first of many AIs sent out by humans to explore and colonise the galaxy, it is just the beginning of your programmed mission - to lay the groundwork for humans, and build a gateway generator to connect with one back on Earth, and allow them to come.

Mission info:

Due to energy and mass limitations on deep space travel, you have arrived with little equipment - solar panels to power yourself and your machinery, a mining robot, electric multipurpose furnace and a mini-fabricator. You will need to bootstrap yourself back up to a level where you have the capability to build the gateway generator you were sent to erect. Your first step is to head for the asteroid belt and find the resources you need.
